## 📖 Overview

Access to essential medicines remains a major challenge due to limited pharmacy workforce, geographic barriers, and recurring medicine shortages. These issues often delay treatment, increase healthcare costs, and force patients to visit multiple pharmacies before obtaining prescribed medications. Existing digital platforms frequently lack centralized and accurate pharmacy inventory data, resulting in unreliable availability information.

**MediTrack+** is a web-based application designed to solve this problem by providing a **centralized, location-based search platform** for medicine availability across multiple pharmacies. By integrating geolocation services and pharmacy inventory data, MediTrack+ enables users to quickly locate nearby pharmacies with available stocks of essential medicines—reducing inconvenience and improving continuity of care.
